# Workflow for analyzing differential gene expression from RNA-sequencing data
Emma Tung Corcoran (10/07/2020)

## Introduction
This document covers my basic workflow for processing paired-end RNA sequencing samples and analyzing differential gene expression. I used the [Ruddle HPC cluster at the Yale Center for Research Computing] (https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/clusters/ruddle/) for my HPC environment.

## Setup
